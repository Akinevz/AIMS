# AIMS

As the title suggests, this project "aims" to produce something, that being a somewhat usable piece of till software.

My intended features include:

* Basic till operation.
* A way for items to be loaded into objects, and thus manipulated through the till.
* An inventory management system, that can be mapped to all the objects within the shop.
* An end of day logging system.
* Ability to add users, items, and change receipt form.
